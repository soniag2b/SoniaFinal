         <p>It is a Herculean task to limit the helicopters traffic and noise in New York City: several bills have been introduced in 2022, at the city, state, and federal levels, but they are not close to be voted as laws.</p>
        <p>Melissa Elstein, the coalition organizer, and volunteer of the grass-roots organization “Stop the Chop” explains that “any environment battle is long. We are up against a polluting industry.”</p>
        <p>These bills aim at banning all non-essential helicopter traffic due to noise complaints, all referring to the 311 Service, with mention of safety concerns and pollution exposure. In total, there have been 66,563 complaints about helicopter noise in all New York City. This type of complaint is ranking number 66 amongst all types of complaints recorded at the NYC 311 Service Requests since 2010.</p>
       <p>Elstein added that “there is a multitude of alternate ways to admire New York City. Plus, why not regulating this industry? The CityBike are not polluting and are more regulated than the helicopter industry.”  As for the economic impact of closing a Heliport, Elstein stated that “lease agreements for these heliports are very low while there is a cost to maintain the piers.” And she was wondering “what is the cost to society anyway?”</p>
       <p>Months have passed since it was announced triumphantly all over the local news that new bills were on their ways to crack down on non-essential helicopter flights. This is not a new issue, but a re-ignited flame carried by several politicians. Celebrating the introduction of a bill may sound a little too early though.</p>
       <p>Representative Carolyn Maloney introduced bill H.R.7769 on May 13th, 2022.  
        New York State Senator Brad Hoylman introduced bill S7493A on October 29, 2021. 
        Council Member Brewer introduced Introduction No.226 on April 28th, 2022 (31 sponsors).
        Council Member Restler introduced Introduction No.551 on May 5th, 2022 (20 sponsors) and Resolution No.291 on August 11th, 2022 (8 sponsors.)</p>
        <p>Michael Whitesides, press secretary of Council Member Shahana Hanif, explained that at the city level, “the bills first need to be heard in committee. Then a vote takes place. If a bill passes, two things can still happen: it is vetoed by the mayor or it has a veto-proof majority, meaning two-thirds of the city council members -34 votes in which case it becomes a law.” </p>
        <p>This is a very long process which reminds the video and song “I’m just a Bill” by the Schoolhouse Rock that children watch at school to learn about the United States legislative branch. </p>

        <p>The Heliport is at the heart of Manhattan Community Board Six. Since 2017, the Heliport has been limited to essential flights and to a maximum number of 28,800 flights per year. All private and touristic flights are not allowed there: only police, medical, and public interest flights. The Heliport is closed on weekends and only operate between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. from Monday through Friday. </p>
        <p>For Romi Singh, 31, who lives close to the Heliport, it is not a problem: “I barely hear the helicopters, they don’t bother me.” Commenting on the increase of complaints, he added: “old people want to talk to someone.”</p>

        <p>The issue of helicopters flying around and over New York City is real in a society that is facing a big environmental challenge. As Elstein said, “even in France, a law just passed banning all flights if another transportation mean takes less than two hours.” </p>
        <p>David Pechefsky, Assembly Member Robert Carroll’s legislative director said that “there is not a formula” in deciding which issue to push forward. It can be data from 311, it can also be people calling and coming to the office directly. </p>
        <p> Molly Halley, Council Member Lincoln Restler’s legislative director also confirmed that they have people reaching out directly or through social media, not necessarily logging a complaint on 311.</p>
        <p>Indeed, addressing the issue based on the 311 complaints may not be the strongest argument. In 2022, for all New York City, the number one type of complaint is “Residential noise” with 309,593 complaints, 1690 percent more than the helicopter noise complaints. </p>
        <p> For some New Yorkers, ear plugs may still be required today. For others, all this legislation about helicopters may sound like a lot of noise for nothing. </p>
